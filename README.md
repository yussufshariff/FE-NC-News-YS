# Project Overview 

This project is a React-based news platform where users can access and engage with articles. Each article features options for voting and commenting, allowing users to actively participate. The app offers convenient navigation, enabling users to access specific articles via relevant links. The UI is built using React-Bootstrap, and Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the REST endpoint API developed as part of the backend project for this application.
